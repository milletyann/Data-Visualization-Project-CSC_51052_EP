# CSC_51052_EP_Data-Visualization-Project

## Project Description

This project focuses on football match analysis using data visualization techniques. The visualizations provide insights into match-level events, player performance, and team statistics. Using web-based technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combined with D3.js, we created an interactive platform to explore football data dynamically.

The visualizations include:

1. **Match Visualization**: Displays goals in matches, incorporating player positions, ball movements, and Voronoi diagrams.
2. **Player Statistics**: Analyzes individual player performances with detailed metrics.
3. **Team Statistics**: Highlights team performance metrics, comparing home and away teams.

The primary interface for the project is the `index.html` file, which acts as the main entry point for the visualizations. The visualizations can be run locally using a modern web browser.

## Running the Project

To run the visualizations locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GloireLINVANI/CSC_51052_EP_Data-Visualization-Project.git
   cd CSC_51052_EP_Data-Visualization-Project
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). This file serves as the main page for accessing the visualizations.

## Dataset

This project utilizes two datasets:

1. **StatsBomb Open Data**: Provides detailed match-level, player-level, and team-level statistics.

   - [StatsBomb Open Data Repository](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data)

2. **Last Row Tracking Data**: Contains tracking data for specific goals scored by Liverpool FC in 2019 and a few other matches.
   - [Last Row Tracking Data Repository](https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD/Last-Row)

These datasets are processed to generate visualizations that provide meaningful insights into football matches.
